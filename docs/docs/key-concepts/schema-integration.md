# Schema Integration (Zod)

While Interface Forge works great with standard TypeScript interfaces, it also offers powerful integration with schema validation libraries, with first-class support for Zod.

## The `ZodFactory`

The `ZodFactory` is a specialized factory that can infer the shape of your data directly from a Zod schema. This "single source of truth" approach means you don't have to define your types in multiple places, reducing boilerplate and preventing inconsistencies.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { ZodFactory } from 'interface-forge/zod';

// 1. Define your schema
const UserSchema = z.object({
    username: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
    age: z.number().min(18),
});

// 2. Create a factory from the schema
const userFactory = new ZodFactory(UserSchema);

// 3. Build objects that are guaranteed to match the schema
const user = userFactory.build();
```

## How it Works

The `ZodFactory` inspects the provided schema and uses `faker` to generate values that conform to the defined types and constraints.

- `z.string()` -> `faker.lorem.word()`
- `z.string().email()` -> `faker.internet.email()`
- `z.number().min(18)` -> A number greater than or equal to 18
- `z.boolean()` -> `faker.datatype.boolean()`
- and many more...

## Benefits of Schema-First

1.  **Guaranteed Validity**: The data generated by `ZodFactory` is guaranteed to pass the schema's validation.
2.  **Automatic Constraint Handling**: It respects built-in Zod constraints like `.min()`, `.max()`, `.email()`, `.uuid()`, etc., generating appropriate data automatically.
3.  **Less Maintenance**: When you update your Zod schema, your data generation logic is updated automatically.
4.  **Extensibility**: You can still use `.extend()` and other methods to customize the generation beyond what the schema defines.
