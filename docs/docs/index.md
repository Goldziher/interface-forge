# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Interface Forge!

Interface Forge is a TypeScript library for creating strongly typed mock data factories using Faker.js. It provides a `Factory` class that extends Faker.js functionality with type-safe mock data generation, batch operations, and factory composition.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Factories**: Create factories that are fully type-safe, ensuring that your test data always matches your interfaces.
- **Faker.js Integration**: Leverages the full power of Faker.js for generating realistic data.
- **Advanced Composition**: Easily compose factories to create complex data structures.
- **Zod Schema Integration**: Generate mock data directly from your Zod schemas.
- **Extensible**: Customize and extend the library to fit your specific needs.
